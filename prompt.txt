I want to generate a website for showing my weather sensor data.
I want to interfaces for this website:

the first interface is for the Amazon kindle display. The page will be full screen, but it is a small e-reader touch screen, black and white. The content should be clear and simple, low density. The content should be shown over multiple pages. We'll define later on the exact content of each of the pages.

the second interface is for standard computers and phones. It should be still simple, easy to read.

The sensor data come from the Prometheus instance at this address: https://prometheus.972.ovh/

I am interested in the following metrics:

- the rate rate `rain{group="wundeground", instance="home.972.ovh:35007", job="raspi sensors", mode="rate"}`
- the total rain `rain{group="wundeground", instance="home.972.ovh:35007", job="raspi sensors", mode="total"}`
  - I want to know how much it rained over the last day, week, month

- the external temperature `temperature{group="wundeground", instance="home.972.ovh:35007", job="raspi sensors", location="toiture", mode="actual"}`
- the indoor temperature, in the living room `temperature{group="pac", instance="home.972.ovh:35004", job="raspi sensors", location="pac_interieur"}
- the wind speed `wind{group="wundeground", instance="home.972.ovh:35007", job="raspi sensors", mode="speed"}`
- the wind guest `wind{group="wundeground", instance="home.972.ovh:35007", job="raspi sensors", mode="gust"}`
- the wind direction `wind_dir{group="wundeground", instance="home.972.ovh:35007", job="raspi sensors"}`
- the pressure `pressure{group="wundeground", instance="home.972.ovh:35007", job="raspi sensors"}`
- the sun radiation `sun_rad{group="wundeground", instance="home.972.ovh:35007", job="raspi sensors"}`
- the UV index `uv_idx{group="wundeground", instance="home.972.ovh:35007", job="raspi sensors"}`

Build me this website.
I don't want a backend. This will be a very low traffic website.

I want to add the units to the values, and rename the blocks:

- the rate rate --> "Force de la pluie", in mm/h
- the total rain --> "Pluie totale", in mm
- the external temperature
- the indoor temperature --> "Temp. intérieur", in degrees C
- the wind speed --> "Vitesse du vent" in km/h
- the wind guest --> "Vitesse des bourrasques", in km/h
- the wind direction --> "Direction du vent", in degrees, to translate to "nord, sud, ..."
- the pressure  --> "Pression", in Hpa
- the sun radiation  --> "Radiation solaire", in J/m2
- the UV index --> "Index UV", without unit

-

Remove the decimal values for the rain, the wind and UV index

-

Keep only 1 decimal digit for the temperature, pressure and radiation

-

Add a button to switch between the computer and kindle view, for testing on the computer.

-

In the kindle view, move the wind dir to the wind speed and wind guest page

-

Include the view type and the kindle page in the URL anchor, so that we can go directly to the page.

-

Rename "temperature ext" into "Temp. extérieur"

-

In the kindle view, reset the switch page timer to 0 when we switch the page manually

-

In the kindle view, add a button to rotate the page view of 90, so that the kindle can be on the any side

-

the rotate button doesn't work

-

make the rotate button less prominent.

-

Better. But the button only allows 2 orientations. I want to enable the 4 rotations

-

The "switch view" button is gone. I want it back, and I want this
button and the Rotate button to be floating in the top right
corner. Use a rotate arrow emoji for rotate, and another one for the
switch.

-

In the computer page, change the emoji to look like a e-ink reader

-

Nice. In the kindle view, switch the order of the buttons, so that the
switch-view is always the right-most

-

* manual adjustments of the labels

-

The wind direction doesn't work for the desktop view

-

Add '/11' for the UV index unit

-

for the Deskop view, split the boxes into multiple groups:
"Température", "Vent", "Pluie", "Autres"

-

The rain over 1 month doesn't work. And it's missing in the Kindle version

-

Move the "pluie total sur 1 mois" to the rain page

-

also move the the "pluie sur une semaine"

-

is there an auto-refresh on the desktop page?
--> every 60s

---

I don't like the multi-column view. I want a simpler design:
Temperature
[temp ext: ...][temp int: ...]
Vent
[vitesse du vent: ...][bourasques: ...]
etc

-

good. Make the squares all the same size. No need to fill the screen width. I will add more boxes in the future.

-

The desktop page isn't scrollable. Add the scrollbar, I can't see the
bottom of the page

-

> In "Autres", add a link to this image: https://www.meteociel.fr/accueil/lastvigi2.gif, which should link to https://vigilance.meteofrance.fr/fr
y

-

you deleted the css. Undo that!

-

Use this iframe instead of the image: https://vigilance.meteofrance.fr/fr/widget-vigilance/vigilance-departement/46

-

the iframe size is `width="302" height="122"` Make sure the CSS shows it all

-

remove the squares around the sections. Move the section title to the left (don't center it)

> Add a section "Qualité de l'air" with the following queries:
  PM1 `PM1`
  PM2.5 `PM25 - PM1`
  PM10 `PM10 - PM25`

> add a section "Riviéres", with:
  Lot `river_flow{river="Lot"}` and a link to https://www.vigicrues.gouv.fr/station/O823153002
  Dordogne `river_flow{river="Dordogne"}` and a link to https://www.vigicrues.gouv.fr/station/P231502001
  The metrics don't work right now, I'll fix that later

> the air quality metrics don't work (it's a metric query, doesn't work the same way as a function query)
