I want to generate a website for showing my weather sensor data.
I want to interfaces for this website:

the first interface is for the Amazon kindle display. The page will be full screen, but it is a small e-reader touch screen, black and white. The content should be clear and simple, low density. The content should be shown over multiple pages. We'll define later on the exact content of each of the pages.

the second interface is for standard computers and phones. It should be still simple, easy to read.

The sensor data come from the Prometheus instance at this address: https://prometheus.972.ovh/

I am interested in the following metrics:

- the rate rate `rain{group="wundeground", instance="home.972.ovh:35007", job="raspi sensors", mode="rate"}`
- the total rain `rain{group="wundeground", instance="home.972.ovh:35007", job="raspi sensors", mode="total"}`
  - I want to know how much it rained over the last day, week, month

- the external temperature `temperature{group="wundeground", instance="home.972.ovh:35007", job="raspi sensors", location="toiture", mode="actual"}`
- the indoor temperature, in the living room `temperature{group="pac", instance="home.972.ovh:35004", job="raspi sensors", location="pac_interieur"}
- the wind speed `wind{group="wundeground", instance="home.972.ovh:35007", job="raspi sensors", mode="speed"}`
- the wind guest `wind{group="wundeground", instance="home.972.ovh:35007", job="raspi sensors", mode="gust"}`
- the wind direction `wind_dir{group="wundeground", instance="home.972.ovh:35007", job="raspi sensors"}`
- the pressure `pressure{group="wundeground", instance="home.972.ovh:35007", job="raspi sensors"}`
- the sun radiation `sun_rad{group="wundeground", instance="home.972.ovh:35007", job="raspi sensors"}`
- the UV index `uv_idx{group="wundeground", instance="home.972.ovh:35007", job="raspi sensors"}`

Build me this website.
I don't want a backend. This will be a very low traffic website.

I want to add the units to the values, and rename the blocks:

- the rate rate --> "Force de la pluie", in mm/h
- the total rain --> "Pluie totale", in mm
- the external temperature
- the indoor temperature --> "Temp. intérieur", in degrees C
- the wind speed --> "Vitesse du vent" in km/h
- the wind guest --> "Vitesse des bourrasques", in km/h
- the wind direction --> "Direction du vent", in degrees, to translate to "nord, sud, ..."
- the pressure  --> "Pression", in Hpa
- the sun radiation  --> "Radiation solaire", in J/m2
- the UV index --> "Index UV", without unit

-

Remove the decimal values for the rain, the wind and UV index

-

Keep only 1 decimal digit for the temperature, pressure and radiation

-

Add a button to switch between the computer and kindle view, for testing on the computer.

-

In the kindle view, move the wind dir to the wind speed and wind guest page

-

Include the view type and the kindle page in the URL anchor, so that we can go directly to the page.

-

Rename "temperature ext" into "Temp. extérieur"

-

In the kindle view, reset the switch page timer to 0 when we switch the page manually

-

In the kindle view, add a button to rotate the page view of 90, so that the kindle can be on the any side

-

the rotate button doesn't work

-

make the rotate button less prominent.

-

Better. But the button only allows 2 orientations. I want to enable the 4 rotations

-

The "switch view" button is gone. I want it back, and I want this
button and the Rotate button to be floating in the top right
corner. Use a rotate arrow emoji for rotate, and another one for the
switch.

-

In the computer page, change the emoji to look like a e-ink reader

-

Nice. In the kindle view, switch the order of the buttons, so that the
switch-view is always the right-most
